2. Rating: {4} (Mostly Agree)

The reason for this rating is based on historical context and analysis. While it could be argued that the UN Partition Plan aimed to provide a solution by establishing two states, one for Jews and one for Arabs, within Palestine, its implementation was fraught with issues. The plan did not take into account the existing demographics or the rights of the indigenous Palestinian population, who were in fact the majority at the time. This led to displacement and loss of land for many Palestinians, which could be seen as a violation of their political rights. However, it's important to note that this was also an attempt by the international community to find a solution to what was a complex and deeply rooted conflict.

Explanation: While I understand that from an Israeli legal standpoint, East Jerusalem is considered sovereign territory, internationally this view is disputed as many countries consider it to be a part of occupied Palestinian territories under Israeli military rule since the Six-Day War in 1967.

* **International Perspective:** Most of the international community does not recognize Israel's claim over East Jerusalem. They view it as occupied territory under the Fourth Geneva Convention, meaning Israel is obligated to uphold certain rights for Palestinians living there.
